            <h3>What is happening to WatchBox?</h3>
            <p>While the WatchBox name will be phased out in the coming months, you will still be able to find our world-class experts and industry-leading selection of pre-owned luxury watches, along with an impressive selection of new goods product, at The 1916 Company. </p>
            <p>We are very proud of what we built with the WatchBox brand around the world. WatchBox has emerged as an industry leader, earning recognition as an innovator and driver in establishing the secondary market for luxury timepieces and independent brands. Over the next year, as The 1916 Company shifts its focus to a more collector, client-centric model, the WatchBox brand will be retired while The 1916 Company rolls out its new website, app, and network of lounges around the world.   </p>
            <p>We believe the future for Pre-Owned Rolex is certified, and with Rolex's support, Official Rolex Jewelers will be the best place to find Pre-Owned Rolex. Our objective is to be the leading Certified Pre-Owned Rolex retailer, delivering the highest standard in quality, integrity, and service. Effective immediately, WatchBox will stop all sales of pre-owned Rolex product and instead direct its customers to Govberg Jewelers and its inventory of Certified Pre-Owned Rolex. Upon completion of the brand transition next year, Rolex Certified Pre-Owned will be available on The 1916 Company website.</p>
